Chapter 1. Foundations of organizing systems
1.1. The discipline of organizing
To organize is to create capabilities(powers or abilities) by intentionally imposing order and structure. The intention of the book is to develop self-conciousness about what it means to organize things whether they are physical resources or digital resources, and about principles or the basis by which the resources are organized.
There are 4 types of organizing: we organize physical things, we organize information about physical things, we organize digital things, and we organize information about digital things.
